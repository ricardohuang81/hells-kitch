      According to the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, NYC's entertainment industry account for over 305,000 jobs and have an economic output of $104 billion. It just so happens that comic book superheroes and stories rooted in New York City also happens to film as live-action series in New York City.

      A lot of scenes in the Daredevil series took place at Abe Lebewohl Park. Interactions and deals amongst good and evil were commonplace within the recognizable landscapes of the quaint little NYC park. Abe Lebewohl was a refugee from Ukraine and served sandwiches to sports legends Muhammad Ali, Joe DiMaggio and was known to give free food to the homeless and holding events to celebrate his Ukranian-Jewish roots. 1,5000 people attended his funeral after he was gunned down at a nearby park. This park was named after him soon afterwards and is used today as a host for a greenmarket and summer concert series.

      Being that Jessica Jones was originally from Queens in the comic books, as an easter egg relating back to the comic, the live-action series often filmed Jessica Jones crossing the Queensboro Bridge from Manhattan into Queens and vice-versa. It is one of many landmark bridges that surround the island of Manhattan and connects Queens county to Manhattan county. The bridge has 2 levels, has gone through extensive renovation in recent years and is looking better than ever.
