      Trevor Noah takes on the very tall task of replacing longtime host Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning talk/news satire program. Noah joined "The Daily Show" in 2014 as a contributor, two years after making his U.S. television debut on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." The native of South Africa -- born to a black South African mother and a white European father -- has been lauded for his unique, insightful take on current events and ability to sell out international comedy shows. It's also helpful that he is, in the words of his Comedy Central boss, "wickedly funny." Tickets are free based on a lottery system, click the photo to get on the list!

      More than 4,000 solar panels will be constructed over the HVAC units on the Javits Center's Green Roof as part of New York City's largest rooftop solar generation project in directly supporting the city's Green New Deal. Since 2014, 26 bird species and 5 bat species have been identified on the 6.75-acre green roof, helping to reduce energy througout the convention center, absorb millions of gallons of storm water, serving as a new home to area wildlife.

      What was once a midtown nightclub is now Terminal 5, named by Pollstar as the worldâ€™s No. 1 club of its size in ticket sales. And while itâ€™s a great place to take in a concert, itâ€™s perhaps, even better for hosting a small or large private event. The swank multilevel music venue has for distinct room environments, 40-foot ceilings, high-tech sound and lighting, green rooms, ample bathrooms, kitchen space, nearby parking and an easy load-in/out. And the topper, quite literally, is the superb roof deck, home to a great bar and plenty of seating areas and bathrooms. Click the photo to get some tickets for a show there!
