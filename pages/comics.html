      Also known as Clinton and Midtown West, Hell's Kitchen is the prime territory in which several iconic Marvel Comic characters go to battle for and protect. These characters include Matthew Murdock aka Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Frank Castle aka Punisher, and the Defenders. Given that Hell's Kitchen was once known for organized crime, it's fitting that Marvel Comics used it as a central location for superheroes to fight crime and protect its residents.

      Matthew Murdock aka Daredevil's story is mixed with joy and tragedy. His father, a boxer, raised him thinking his mother had passed away. Matt got his powers when he saw a blind man walking towards an oncoming truck and pushed him out the way. A radioactive isotope spilled out, striking Matt across his face, blinding him. Through incident, Matt was blind but had an enhanced, superhuman sense of hearing, smell, taste and touch, developing a "radar sense" that formed mental pictures of his surroundings. With these powers and rigorous fight training in taking after his father, Daredevil is superhero with an indomitable will.

      Born as Carl Lucas, the superhero known as Luke Cage was born and raised on the streets of Harlem, New York City. While in prison because he was framed for a crime he didn't commit, Cage was immersed in the "Electro-Biochemical System" that contained an electrical field conducted by an organic chemical compound and the device was tampered with in attempt to kill Cage, it caused mutagenic change throughout Cage's body, fortifying his cells giving him superhuman strength and durability. During his tribulations as a crimefighter in New York City, he teams up with the likes of Daredevil, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones, his eventual partner in life.

      The Defenders began in the comic books with Sorcerer Supreme Dr. Strange as their leader. Their purpose was to defend Earth from the Underlying Ones. The Hulk, Silver Surfer, Valkyrie and Prince Naymore were just some of the famous comic book characters that were once a part of the Defenders. Later on, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist played their part in the epic superhero allegiance. As a result of the popularity of the Netflix Marvel superhero shows, the Defenders series was spawned as an action-packed mini-series involving most of the main characters that had standalone series (excluding Punisher).
