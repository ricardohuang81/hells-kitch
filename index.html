        Not only is Hell's Kitchen a historical neighbhorhood in New York City filled with culture and history, it is also the epicenter of some of Marvel Comics' most iconic characters and stories. Netflix also brought these comicbook heroes (or anti-heroes) to life with live-action tv shows filmed throughout various hisotrical sites in New York City. This site will celebrate Hell's Kitchen as a neighbhorhood in NYC, a comic book battleground, and the various New York City locations where filming of said live-action comic book shows were filmed.

          Hell’s Kitchen is a place to do it up. There’s cuisine from around the globe: Argentinean empanadas, Japanese ramen, Druze bourekas, Thai street food.  There’s all kinds of nightlife: jazz haunts, LGBTQ+ clubs, dive bars, rooftop lounges. Theater and dance thrive a stone’s throw from Broadway. The High Line’s northern entrance is at the rail yards on this neighborhood’s southern tip. And by the glorious Hudson River Park, there’s the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and the Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises departure point, so you can tour a ship or set sail on one.

          Leading the way in bringing television onto the web with high-speed and quality streaming video, Netflix hosted several live-action series behind the creative vision of Marvel Television in bringing some of its most iconic crime-fighting comic book heroes to life. The shows generated cult-like fandom all over the globe but was consequently cancelled in 2018 and 2019 due to Disney's intentions to create their own streaming service with the Marvel intellectual properties (comic book characters) that they now own.

          Given that New York City has so much history and culture with its concrete jungle-esque skyscrapers, waterfronts overlooking the beautiful skyline, along with historical parks, buildings and neighborhoods, it's only fitting that a lot of television/movie filming happens here. In re-creating these iconic comic book characters as live-action heroes, a lot of the filming of these shows took place at historical sites right here in New York City. This photo of Jon Bernthal in the Punisher series was captured in Greenpoint, Brooklyn during an early scene in the show.
